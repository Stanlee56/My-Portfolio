Special Treats for Valentine’s Day
Remember that we have lots of small items (in addition to complete party fare) that our catering staff can provide. One of our most popular items this season has been our delicious home-made marshmallows. These confectionary delights are made with our own homemade vanilla and are dusted with powdered sugar. They make wonderful gourmet s'mores, but are at their best floating on top of a cup of rich hot cocoa.
