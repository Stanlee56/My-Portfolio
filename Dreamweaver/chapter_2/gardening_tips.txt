Seasonal Gardening Checklist 

Fall – The time to plant trees and spring-blooming bulbs. Take the time to clean the leaves and dead foliage from your beds and lawn.
Winter – The time to prune fruit trees and finish planting your bulbs. Don’t forget to water young trees when the ground is dry.
Spring – The time to prepare your beds, plant annuals, and apply fertilizer to established plants. Remember to mulch to maintain moisture and prevent weed growth.
Summer – The time to supplement rainfall so that plants get one inch of water per week. Plant your vegetable garden and enjoy bountiful harvests until late fall.
