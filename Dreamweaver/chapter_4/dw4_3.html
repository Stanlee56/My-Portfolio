		  <p>Destination: Egypt</p>
		  <p>We  have a really special trip planned for next November. Egypt - the land of kings and pharaohs! This ten-day adventure will begin in Cairo as we visit the Giza Plateau to see the pyramids of Cheops, Chepheren, and Mycerinus. We will also visit the Great Sphinx and the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities before we leave Cairo for our cruise along the Nile. We board the Egyptian Queen at Luxury and enjoy stops along the way to the Valley of the Kings, the Valley of the Queens, the Ptolemaic temple, the Temple of Horus, and the Temple of Philae on the island of Agilika. When we return to Cairo, you will have the opportunity to do some shopping in the famous Khan El-Khalili  Bazaar and enjoy an unforgettable performance  of the El-TannouraÂ  Egyptian Heritage Dance Troup.</p>
